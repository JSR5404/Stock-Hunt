# StockHunt!
A mock stock trading app so that you can watch market trends and "invest" in the stock market without spending any real money! 

## Description
StockHunt is perfect for aspiring stock traders, students, and any other individuals interested in diversifying their finances but want to do so without risking real US dollars. 

Users will make an account through which to log in and out of the app with, and will use an interactive search bar to search and save any stocks they've decided to add to their portfolio. You'll feel just like Jordan Belfort!

## Installation

N/A. [Deployed site here!](https://tranquil-retreat-75935.herokuapp.com/)


## Usage

Simply make an account through the signup tab on the navigation bar, then switch to our search function to find any and all stocks you want to keep track of. When you switch to the dashboard tab, your stocks will be there waiting with their current prices and any other relevant info!


## Roadmap

We will be planning to add more to StockHunt in the coming weeks and months, as right now its functionality is pretty bare minimum. Some more user-friendly styling will be crucial, and some additional features like a line graph showing each stock's value over time would be great additions.
